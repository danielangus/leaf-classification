## Capstone Proposal

April 2017

For the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project I will complete the Kaggle Leaf Classification challenge. 

### Domain Background

The goal of this project is to classify leaves from various species of plants. This is a difficult task for humans to perform since there are estimated to be nearly half a million species of plants in the world (per the challenge description). With machine learning-based automation of the classification process, we can gain insight into the spread of plant species and population counts.

### Problem Statement

The problem is to correctly identify 99 different species of plants from their leaves.

### Datasets and Inputs

There are two datasets with which to apply classifiers. The first is 1,584 images of leaves - 16 images for each of the 99 species). The second is a csv file of extracted features. 
There are three sets of features in the csv file:
* shape - describes the shape of the leaf
* margin - describes the fine details of the leaf
* texture - descibes the interior structure of the leaf
Each of the three feature sets contains 64 columns, for a total of 192 extracted features.
