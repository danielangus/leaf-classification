# Leaf Classification

## Summary

This repository contains the Capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. The project is the [leaf classification challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification) from Kaggle. The objective of the challenge is to generate a multi-class classifier of leaves from 99 species of plants.

The code folder contains a jupyter notebook for exploratory analysis and visualizations, and a folder for each stage of the analysis:
* step1 : train a variety of classifiers on the dataset with minimal optimization
* step2 : train a deep neural network on the dataset
* step3 : optimize the classifiers from step1 and step2

The data folder contains a folder of leaf images and a .csv file of extracted features for both the train and test datasets. The submissions folder contains formatted submissions for entry into Kaggle. Running a program from step1, step2, or step3 will generate a submission in this folder.
